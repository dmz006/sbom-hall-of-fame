# 🏆 SBOM Hall of Fame 🏆 
> *A place for the InfoSec community to share and celebrate real stories of organizations successfully using SBOMs (and other bills of material) to actually manage and reduce security risk in meaningful ways.*

Depending on who you ask in the InfoSec community, SBOMs are going to radically improve the state of software security around the world **OR** they're a total waste of time. 

It's high time we found a better way to cut through the noise and **make it far easier for the InfoSec community to share and learn about SBOM success stories so it's easier for folks to figure out how to get value out of, or provide value with, SBOMs in their organizations**.

This is the stated purpose of the...

Do you want to help organizations see the light around how to use SBOMs (and other BOM types) in practical ways that actually provide value? Submit a pull request to add to the table below!

| VMware Tanzu by Broadcom | SBOM | CUPS vulnerability 2024-09-26 | In September of 2024 a security researcher disclosed a possible RCE with the common unix printing system or CUPS.  When the details of his research were published at 3:59pm on September 23rd Tanzu security and R&D teams immediately analized all products for potential risk from this vulnerability.  Tanzu customers build and run the largest applications in the most complex business enivoronments and rapidly determining risks to vulnerabilities is a regular procedure.  The Tanzu team reviewed the SBOM for all active releases for all products for any that may be using CUPS.  The review only took a few minutes and in less than an hour from the vulnerability release customers were being notified that while Tanzu Platform for Cloud Foundry did include libcups in the application stack, the vulnerable applications were not present in any Tanzu system, platform or product. | [Speed up your CVE response time with SBOMs (from VMware Tanzu by Broadcom)](https://blogs.vmware.com/tanzu/speed-up-your-cve-response-time-with-sboms/) |
| VMware Tanzu by Broadcom | SBOM | XZ vulnerability 2024-03-29 | In March of 2024 a simple micro-benchmarking of SSH identified a suspicious response prompting an investigation that identified a back-door in the XZ library.  Because the attack was on the supply chain Tanzu was able to use the SBOM and provenance information of the secure build and sourcing of Tanzu product components to determine that the vulnearable libraries never made it into the supply chain that Tanzu uses and were not found in any Tanzu product. | [How VMware Tanzu was Impacted by the XZ Vulnerability: Spoiler Alert—It Wasn’t!

| VMware Tanzu by Broadcom | SBOM/SPDX | SBOM/SPDX for all Application Catalog Inventory | Tanzu Application Catalog is the commercial version of the Bitnami catalog and has been offering results of a variety of tests for the applications including CVE scanning, antivirus/malware and functional tests of helm deployments on supported platforms.  Starting in April 2023,  SBOMs in SPDX format are included with all Tanzu Application Catalog containers and Helm charts. Created at build time, these SBOMS provide details for components, licenses, copyrights, and security references for artifacts shipped through the catalog. With the new SBOM and SPDX information customers are able to have their supply chains and pipelines validate and document the as-built status of applications and monitor for security updates and other details needed to consume regular updates to critical infrastructure components consumed by Tanzu Application catalog customers. * | [*VMware Application Catalog Now Delivers Open Source SBoMs in SPDX Format (from VMware Tanzu by Broadcom)](https://blogs.vmware.com/tanzu/vmware-application-catalog-now-delivers-open-source-sbom-in-spdx-format/) [VMware Tanzu Application Catalog: Introducing Global Catalog Insights and Compliance Results (from VMware Tanzu by Broadcom)](https://blogs.vmware.com/tanzu/introducing-global-catalog-insights-and-compliance-results/) |
